You will assign an array to a variable which will contain a copy of the array mixedLetters and 6 other letters.
You will create an arrow function which should take two parameters. This function should combine all the argument passed in into a single array and sort them and reverse them and then return this array
You are free to choose an arrow function of your choice to do this.
Within the function body, you are free to create the array any way you want, but try to look out for opportunities to use what you have been learning in the advanced JavaScript material.
Create a variable named: moreMixedLetters using the keyword let
Assign an array to the variable moreMixedLetters which should be a copy of the array mixedLetters and then the following values: 'h', 'k', 'g', 'j', 'i', 'l' (note steps 1 and 2 should be done on a single line)
log out moreMixedLetters
Create a variable named: updateSortReverse using the keyword const
Assign the variable updateSortReverse an arrow function
The arrow function should take two parameters one named: arr and another named: letters which should use the rest parameter syntax
This arrow function should combine all the argument passed in into a single array and sort them and reverse them and then return this array
Create a variable named reverseSort using the keyword let
Variable reverseSort should be assigned the return value from calling the updateSortReverse function passing in the moreMixedLetters array and the string values: 'n', 'm', 'o'
log out the variable reverseSort to see its value
log out the variable mixedLetters to see that it has not been changed if you have done everything correctly
